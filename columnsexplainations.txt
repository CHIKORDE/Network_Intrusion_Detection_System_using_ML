Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of each of the 10 selected features used for intrusion detection — perfect for your report:

📊 Explanation of Reduced Features for Intrusion Detection
Feature Name	Meaning / Role in Traffic	Why It Matters for Attack Detection
1. Flow Duration	Total time (in micro/milliseconds) a connection/flow lasted between two endpoints.	Long or extremely short durations can indicate abnormal sessions (e.g., bot activity, port scanning).
2. Total Fwd Packets	Total number of packets sent from source to destination (forward direction).	Sudden spikes can indicate a flood or data exfiltration.
3. Total Backward Packets	Total number of packets sent from destination to source (reverse direction).	Helps compare normal 2-way conversations with suspicious 1-way traffic.
4. Flow Bytes/s	Average bytes transmitted per second in the flow.	Very high throughput in a short time may suggest DoS/DDoS or brute force attempts.
5. Flow Packets/s	Average number of packets transmitted per second in the flow.	High packet rates may indicate SYN floods or scan behavior.
6. Fwd Packet Length Mean	Mean size of packets going in the forward direction.	Consistently large or small packet sizes might indicate tunneling or command/control traffic.
7. Bwd Packet Length Mean	Mean size of packets in the reverse (response) direction.	Can detect if the server is replying with large data or error codes (e.g., during an exploit).
8. Fwd IAT Mean	Mean time between packets sent in the forward direction (Inter-Arrival Time).	Low variability or consistent intervals may point to automated tools or malware.
9. Bwd IAT Mean	Mean time between packets in the reverse direction.	Helps detect response behavior—slow replies may be indicative of resource overload under attack.
10. SYN Flag Count	Number of TCP packets with the SYN (synchronize) flag set in a session.	High SYN counts are a hallmark of SYN flood attacks (DoS), where sessions are never completed.

🛡️ Summary for Report
These features were selected for their strong ability to capture abnormal traffic patterns such as:

High volume (DDoS)

Unusual timing (botnets, scanners)

Protocol misuse (SYN floods, tunneling)

Unbalanced communication (data leaks, backdoors)
